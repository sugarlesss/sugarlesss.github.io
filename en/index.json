[{"categories":["闲聊"],"content":"About Content and Tools I’ve been trying to use some note taking software for about half a year now, and I’ve gradually fallen into the swamp of searching and experiencing all kinds of note taking software, which seems to be a strange circle that shouldn’t exist: looking for a note taking app, experiencing it, and looking for the next note taking app, but we shouldn’t be like this, originally wanting to find a good weapon to fight with, but finally becoming a shopkeeper of a weapon store. Recently gradually realized, should gradually return to the original heart, think of what content, find the right place to start writing immediately, the content is far more important than the carrier. No longer go to spend a lot of time looking for good tools, focus on content output, improve their own, obviously more important.
